Correctly implement lineBasedOutput for ssh.

Maybe switch default of lineBasedOutput to True.

Allow execution of a single test out of the list of test definitions.

Expected failures may happen at unexpected places. Instead of the current
'xfail': True attribute in the test definition, we should better mark the
exact operation that's expected to fail as such.

Correct dependency tracking, maybe using some DAG based approach. This just
got more important with resources that only allow a single child. Although
the main issue probably is that suites get started even if absolutely
unneeded, just to make sure no test gets skipped because its requirements
cannot be fulfilled.

The main routine returns with exit code 0 even if tests failed.
