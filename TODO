Allow execution of a single test out of the list of test definitions.

Expected failures may happen at unexpected places. Instead of the current
'xfail': True attribute in the test definition, we should better mark the
exact operation that's expected to fail as such.

Correct dependency tracking, maybe using some DAG based approach.
